# file-sorter

This project is meant to sort files automatically on my pc that are downloaded from the web. I hate having to download a file then search through hundreds of other files to find it, so I made this automatic file sorter for me to have an easier time. It uses the Google Clould Natural Languange processor to categorize pdf files into subsets for easy location. For security reasons, I replaced a lot of the file locations with a filler, along with not adding my google JSON key file.
